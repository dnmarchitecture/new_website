Crafted by Scott Bell, Alameda, CA, using White Oak and aluminum, the shoe bench is simple, practical and delightful. Its sole function is to be a place to just sit and leave your shoes. Everything else is stripped away. The design departs from the idea of a typical slatted bench by turning the slats 90 degrees so they form profiles that are the seat, the support and the shoe shelf. Nothing else is needed. The 3/4" profiles are crafted from solid White Oak, biscuited in the corners and spaced 3/4" apart. Square aluminum bars hold the profiles in place and carry the body's weight horizontally to the two aluminum struts.
