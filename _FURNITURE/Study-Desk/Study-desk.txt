This study desk was crafted by Scott Bell, Alameda, CA, in White Oak. Suspended from the wall, it appears to wrap around itself as it fills the width of a small study room. The simple drawer and cabinet doors conceal a slide-out keyboard support and interior drawers.A mocha accent color on the back wall complements the Oak.
