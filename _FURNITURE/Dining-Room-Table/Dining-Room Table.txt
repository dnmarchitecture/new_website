The dining room table is made entirely from two slabs of recovered California Bay hand selected from Arborico in western Marin county, CA and finished with clear satin MonoKote. The raw edges of the wood slabs are left exposed on the table base and smooth finished on the tops. Four leaves permit the table to be configured as a 4' diameter round table up to a 10' oval table, seating twelve. A round and a two-leaf configuration are shown here.

Set on a Walnut floor amid White Oak cabinetry, the table appears substantial but not ormnate. It expresses its materiality and draws the eye to the beautiful color and veining of the wood. Master furniture maker Paul Murphy, Oakland, CA, discretely concealed the mechanics supporting the top and leaves under the top so they do not distract from the simple beauty of the wood itself.
