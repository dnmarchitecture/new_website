This top floor apartment in a stately two-unit building in San Francisco's Presidio Heights neighborhood enjoyed expansive Bay views to the north and city views to the south, but it suffered from a dark spaces, an obsolete floor plan and years of neglect. In a top to bottom remodel, DNM Architect opened up the space internally and to the outdoors using a minimalist contemporary palette of White Oak, Walnut and understated surfaces that emphasize light, views, and the owner's extensive art collection.
