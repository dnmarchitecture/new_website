      <p style="text-align: justify"><i>"I cannot rate this firm too highly. I retained DNM for a very complicated new home project -- a three story house built on piers over San Francisco Bay. There were huge structural and engineering issues, not to mention a host of code issues to solve. Plus I had definite ideas regarding the design aesthetics. Could this house even be built the way I envisioned? What I got from David Marlatt and his team was they listened, they offered a range of solutions with best-choice recommendations based on experience, and where ideas counter to mine were required the ideas/solutions they came up with were superior to mine, both practically and aesthetically. Every time. Thanks to their advice, this house came out better than I could ever have imagined, and when that's the result you know you are working with professionals. I was, and am, a completely satisfied client."</i></p>

    </div>

    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="san-francisco-remodel"> 

      <p style="text-align: justify"><i>"David Marlatt did a super job for me on my San Francisco, Presidio Heights home. The first project was a big remodel of kitchen, dining room and basement and involved redesign of space, and major engineering and earthquakeproofing issues. The second one was simpler, being a remodel of the living room. David is very personable, competent, and easy to work with. He makes really good suggestions from his wide range of knowledge, but is always working to make sure that you are getting what you want in the end design. The contractor, subcontractors and engineers he suggested were all very good, and obviously had good working relationships with him. If issues came up he was very good at resolving them, and he was always there when we needed him. I would wholeheartedly recommend David to you for any house project, and I send my friends to him."</i></p>

    </div>

    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="green-modern-home">

      <p style="text-align: justify"><i>"We recommend DNM very highly. David Marlatt and his team at DNM designed a wonderful contemporary-style house for us. In addition to being gorgeous, it is very “green”, energy efficient and well tailored to our needs. David went to great effort to design the house we wanted rather than insist on a particular vision if it did not meet our goals. He also did a lot of work to orient and fit our house to a hillside lot that presented multiple design challenges, and created some particularly clever and fun design elements. Another thing we appreciate is that the firm is very business-oriented and clear about the financial aspects of working with them. DNM's use of sophisticated computer software and techniques made it easier for us to "see" how the house would look and operate, and make design changes. For example, DNM used software and a PG&E database to model daily sun movement over the house, to help design such passive elements as overhangs to minimize heat in summer while allowing the sun to enter and warm the house in winter. David also helped us find, evaluate and choose a really great contractor; and he provided helpful construction phase services to resolve questions that came up during construction and made suggestions as we chose specific elements and fixtures for the house. It was a pleasure working with DNM."</i></p>

    </div>

    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="noe-valley-renovation"> 

      <p style="text-align: justify"><i>"We hired DNM Architect for a major home renovation and are very happy with the services provided. DNM Architect successfully guided us through an extremely complex and frustrating web of rules and regulations imposed by the City of San Francisco to obtain our building permits and complete the home remodel. We are very happy in our wonderful new home thanks to DNM Architect."</i></p>

    </div>

    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="repeat-clients"> 

      <p style="text-align: justify"><i>"We have used David for 2 projects, the remodeling of our house and the rebuilding of our detached garage in San Francisco. We love both results and are grateful to David. This was our first experience remodeling and we appreciated his patience explaining us all we should care about. He is a very creative architect who knows how to optimize space. He is resourceful with issues both in terms of space and code. He was of great advice for all the aspects of our projects from design options identification to interior details. He is very sensitive to "green" building. We would definitively use him again and highly recommend him."</i></p>

    </div>

    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="contractor"> 

      <p style="text-align: justify"><i>"We are general contractors and have worked with DNM architect for 5 years. We have finished 7 projects together. What makes DNM architect such a great partner is their thoroughness in the pre-construction process. A delight for every contractor as well as for the homeowner. A well thought out plan makes the building/remodel process go very smooth which will allow homeowner and contractor to stay on budget and deliver a beautiful end product. DNM architect designs are always very realistic, smart, diverse and most of all what the client wants."</i></p>

    </div>

    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="new-oakland-home"> 

      <p style="text-align: justify"><i>"DNM Architect was instrumental in bringing my vision to realization. David was not only knowledgeable and professional but he is extremely patient, thoughtful and listens. I enjoyed getting to know David and working with DNM architect during the 2 years that it took to work on my project. My project was complicated, unique and required a higher level of attention to detail but DNM Architect was able to work diligently to get the project done well. It is with great confidence and pleasure that I can strongly recommend and support DNM Architect."</i></p>

    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="commercial"> 

      <p style="text-align: justify"><i>"Commercial space remodeling plans, contractor selection and oversight completed on time and on budget.

    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="marin-remodel"> 

      <p style="text-align: justify"><i>"David and his team are excellent! We hired David to do the architectural design for the remodel at our new home. He was efficient, cost-effective, very thorough, and easy to work with. He is also very trustworthy, clear and considerate of your goals (i.e. style, budget). I would highly recommend DNM architect for any upcoming projects. Again, he is fantastic!"</i></p>

    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="presidio-heights"> 

      <p style="text-align: justify"><i>"Some of the many things I appreciate about David Marlatt, my architect on a large and fairly complex home project: He is imaginative, personable, calm, prompt, works extremely well with contractors and vendors, delivers designs / changes promptly. Not only an excellent sense of design architecturally, but also for interiors, fixtures, etc. Thorough practical knowledge base and expertise in dealing with the multitude of City / regulatory issues. Everything - design, budgets, timing, etc - is thought through carefully, and from many angles. Thoroughly receptive to client preferences, but will also be directive when needed. As his client, I'm am never in doubt that my interests are his highest priority.</p>
      
      <p style="text-align: justify">Plans and designs are created, stored and presented electronically - in 3D renderings as well as floor plans. Easy for those of us who are 3D-challenged to follow.</p>

      <p style="text-align: justify">In my view, outstanding in all areas. I can confidently recommend David without reservation."</i></p>

    <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane" id="urban-LEED-home"> 

      <p style="text-align: justify"><i>"DNM Architect has designed my new custom build house in the Castro in San Francisco. Both from a pure design and (technical) building support point of view, David Marlatt and team have done a wonderful job. The end product is a stunning 5 story house that is incredibly comfortable and practical to live in."</i></p>
