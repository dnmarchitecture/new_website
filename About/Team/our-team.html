    <p style="text-align: justify"><i>Founder, DNM Architect</i></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight:bold; color:blue;">David Marlatt</span> graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1982 with an M.ARCH and began practicing in Atlanta with Taylor+Williams Architects where his houses and multi-family projects won national awards and publication. He obtained his architectural license at the tender age of 25 and soon after made the rational decision to quit his job and leave town. A true architect was born...</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">He debarked in Paris in 1986 and taught architectural design briefly before joining a local start-up software company, ABVENT (http://www.abvent.com/), developers of 3D modeling and rendering software. Abvent quickly grew as both a developer and software distributor and, in 1987, became one of the first distributors of Hungarian based Graphisoft's ArchiCAD (http://www.graphisoft.com/), the original "BIM" software. David left Paris in 1992 for San Francisco, where he served as President of Graphisoft's US office - and later as International VP of Marketing and Communications - and helped grow Graphisoft into a major worldwide player in architectural CAD software.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">Always an architect, however, David left Graphisoft after its successful initial public offiering (IPO) in 1999 to form DNM Architecture. Working throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, DNM Architecture, offers a full range of architectural services from planning and programming through design, documentation and construction administration. Pushing the envelope of architectural practice and technology, the firm uses intelligent 3D CAD software to communicate with clients, translate early designs seamlessly into construction documents and manage design changes without disrupting the building process. The firm’s integrated approach not only improves the final design, but produces final drawings faster and more accurately than more traditional methods.</p>
