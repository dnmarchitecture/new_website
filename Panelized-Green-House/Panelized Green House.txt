The clients, both professionals, desired a flexible home that included a private retreat, guest suite, indoor/outdoor entertaining, and offices that could easily be converted to bedrooms for future resale. Built on piers over the bay, the house is organized into two ‘pavilions’ around a central court containing the entry and a second floor hot tub. The court provides shelter against the near constant wind and brings light throughout the house.

The east pavilion contains the master suite, guest suite and sitting room. The guest suite and sitting room can be combined into a one bedroom accessible apartment if needed. The west pavilion contains public spaces on the lower floor and his and her offices that can be converted to bedrooms on the upper floor.

The house also incorporates many green features such as a shaded south facing glass, a 3kw photovoltaic system, high efficiency furnaces, and lime based plaster that off gasses less CO2 than cement plaster.
