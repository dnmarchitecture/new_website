Featured in the book, Prefabulous, by Sheri Koones, this panelized house is built on concrete piers over water and features an open plan for living and entertaining on the first floor and private quarters plus a roof garden on the second floor. A small meditation tower on the third floor commands views across the San Francisco Bay.

The plan is organized to maximize light and views with the kitchen and master bath suite oriented towards the morning sun and the living spaces and roof garden oriented to the wind sheltered marina and the afternoon light. The large two car garage was split and rotated 45 degrees to reduce its visual impact and create an inviting entry court. The serrated roof over the master bedroom is rotated 45 degrees towards the south to accommodate future photovoltaic panels.

While it incorporates complex spaces and custom details, the entire house was panelized off site to save both time and money.
