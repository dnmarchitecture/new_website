The original Victorian house was constructed before 1890, however, it had endured several insensitive remodels and needed an update for its new owners, a family of five. The project included remodeling of the entire interior, addition of a new master bathroom, addition of a family room in the basement level and a two-story bay window projection into the rear yard. The street facade was a careful restoration of the original Victorian while the interiors open up to create a series of complementary, but light-filled spaces.

Working closely with the owners and contractor, and navigating San Francisco's building permit requirements adroitly, the entire project was completed in less than six months.
